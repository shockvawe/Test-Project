2. using of main method is not necessary in Testng

3.Unlike Junit Testng annotations are easy to understand and use too.

4. Parallel execution is possiblein TestNg

5. Using data providers we can perforn datadriven framework with both hard coded or through excel file.

uncaught exceptions are handled by testNg without terminating the tests and these exceptions are reported in failed test cases 

Cross browser testing is possible in testNg (i.e) we can execute multiple test cases on multiple browsers 

We can use methods like groups, depends on groups and depends on methods to run the test case in groups to perform testing like regression, smoke and sanity

practising testNg programs daily would build confidence
